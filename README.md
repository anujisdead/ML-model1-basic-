*LINEAR REGRESSION AND RANDOM FORESTS:*
This model is built from :
delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv
This dataset contains the parameters regarding the solubility of molecules.
I have built the model for this dataset using two algorithms:
1.Linear Regression
2.Random Forest generator
Both of these models being similar return a slight variation of values towards the end.

*K NEAREST NEIGHBOURS*
This is a basic model built on glass.csv file.
KNN uses a simple methodology of smallest eucledian distance between data poionts and K represents the number of nearest neighbours we use to get the value of the newset data point

*SVC*
Prediction of diabetes using SVC supervised learning model.
Prediction of breast cancer using SVC supervised learning model
