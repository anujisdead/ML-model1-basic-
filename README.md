This model is built from :
delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv
This dataset contains the parameters regarding the solubility of molecules.
I have built the model for this dataset using two algorithms:
1.Linear Regression
2.Random Forest generator
Both of these models being similar return a slight variation of values towards the end.
